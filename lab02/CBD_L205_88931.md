### Get some info (name, category_code, founded_year, number_of_employees, total_money_raised, offices) about the companies not in the USA
`db.companies.find({"offices.0.country_code": {$ne:"USA"}}, {name: 1, category_code: 1, founded_year: 1, number_of_employees: 1, total_money_raised: 1, offices:1})`

### Get the number of companies that belong to the category messaging
`db.companies.find({category_code: "messaging"}).count()` 

### Get the companies that have, at least, 100 000 employees
`db.companies.find({number_of_employees: {$gte:100000}})`

### Get the name and fouded_year of companies that were founded after 2005
`db.companies.find({founded_year:{$gt:2005}}, {name:1, founded_year:1})`

`db.companies.find({competitions: {$exists:true}, $where:"this.competitions.length > 25"})`

### Get the companies that have `Drive` in the name
`db.companies.find({name:/Drive/})`


## (d) Aggregate queries

### Get the average number of employees for each category
`db.companies.aggregate([{$group: {_id:  "$category_code", avg_of_employees: {$avg: "$number_of_employees"}}}])`

### Get the number of employees that belong to each category ordered in an ascending order
`db.companies.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$category_code", total: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {"total":1}}])`

### Get the average money raised for each category in a descending order
`db.companies.aggregate([{$group: {_id:  "$category_code", total: {$sum: "$total_money_raised"}}}, {$sort: {total_money_raised: -1}}])`

### Get the number of companies that were found each year
`db.companies.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$founded_year", total: {$sum: 1}}}])`

### Get the company names that have a Total funding greater than 10000000 and that have `Drive` in the name
`db.companies.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {id: "$name", total_funding: {"$sum": "$funding_rounds.raised_amount"}}}}, {$match: {"_id.total_funding":{$gt:10000000},"_id.id":/Drive/}}])`

### Get the number of prodcuts for each company in a descendent order
```
db.companies.aggregate(
   [
     {$project: {
         name: 1,
         n_of_products: { $cond: { if: { $isArray: "$products" }, then: { $size: "$products" }, else: "NA"} }}},
      {$sort:{"n_of_products":-1}}
    ]
)
```

### Get the number of acquistions for each company in a descendent order

     {$project: {
         name: 1,

      {$sort:{"n_of_acquisitions":-1}}
    ]
)
```

### Get the number of investments for each company in a descendent order
